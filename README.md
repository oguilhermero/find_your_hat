# Find Your Hat
Walk through the maze with U, D, L, R commands to find the hat (^)!
PS: you're not always going to be able to play the game. Press ctrl + C and load the program again.

## Known limitations
1. Random .generate() static class does not check on impossible mazes.
2. Randomized .generate() is always evaluating over 40% possibility of generating a hole character in the field.
